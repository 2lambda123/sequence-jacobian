    "This notebook serves as an introduction to the `sequence-jacobian` toolkit and the classes and main functions it provides for solving dynamic general equilibrium models in sequence space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction will cover the following topics:\n",
    "0. `sequence-jacobian` preliminaries\n",
    "    - The `sequence-jacobian` toolkit directory structure\n",
    "    - Importing `sequence-jacobian`\n",
    "1. How do `Block` objects work?\n",
    "2. The main functions of `sequence-jacobian`\n",
    "    - `steady_state`\n",
    "    - `get_G`\n",
    "    - `td_map`\n",

    "The notebook accompanies the working paper by Auclert, Bardóczy, Rognlie, Straub (2019): \"Using the Sequence-Space Jacobian to Solve and Estimate Heterogeneous-Agent Models\". Please see the [Github repository](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian) for more information and code.\n",
