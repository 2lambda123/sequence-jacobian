    "1. **(Recommended) Using `pip`**: You can install `sequence-jacobian` using `pip`, python's native package-management system, by executing the following command in your python console with `pip` loaded: `pip install git+https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian@develop-cai`. Alternatively you can append `python -m ` to the front of that command and execute it directly in the terminal.\n",
    "2. **Using sys.path.append()**: You can directly clone the `sequence-jacobian` repository from Github [here](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian/tree/develop-cai), import the `sys` package inside your python console, and call `sys.path.append(<the/path/to/sequence_jacobian>)`. E.g. if you want to run this notebook, you can call `sys.path.append(..)`.\n",
    "3. **Using `conda`**: While `conda` does not have a straightforward way of building from source like `pip`, if you prefer to work within `conda` environments, you can create a `conda` environment and then use `pip` as above to install `sequence-jacobian` within your `conda` environment."

    "Here we can solve for inflation, `pi`, to ensure that the target equation, `nkpc`, is satisfied without having to reference equations in other `Block` objects. This is in contrast to specifying the same equation as a `SimpleBlock`, which would require the user to include the unknown `pi` and target `nkpc` at the top level of the DAG with the rest of the unknowns and targets.\n",

    "The advantage of this approach is that it improves computational efficiency by streamlining the DAG evaluation process. For example, instead of asking the root-finding algorithm to solve an $n$-dimensional problem in a DAG without a `SolvedBlock`, the root-finding algorithm would instead only have to solve a reduced problem, where along the evaluation path it would additionally solve the unidimensional root-finding problem provided by the `SolvedBlock`. While it's not absolutely necessary to break out every possible `SolvedBlock` within the DAG, it may improve performance for large-scale models."
