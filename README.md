# Sequence-Space Jacobian

A unified framework to solve and analyze heterogeneous-agent macro models.

Python toolkit based on [Auclert, Bard√≥czy, Rognlie, Straub (2021): "Using the Sequence-Space Jacobian to Solve and Estimate Heterogeneous-Agent Models"](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17434) [[ungated copy]](http://mattrognlie.com/sequence_space_jacobian.pdf).

**Important Note:** This page currently reflects version 1.0.0-alpha of the toolkit. This is a preliminary release of an extensively overhauled and improved version of the old toolkit. Unfortunately, we do not yet have any documentation or tutorials available for this new version, although these are coming soon!

For now, most users will probably want to visit and download the toolkit from the [original toolkit page](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian/tree/bcca2eff6041abc77d0a777e6c64f9ac6ff44305) instead, which has instructions and extensive Jupyter notebooks that walk through the process of using the toolkit.

## 1. Resources

- New documentation and tutorials are coming soon. Please see the [original toolkit page](https://github.com/shade-econ/sequence-jacobian/tree/bcca2eff6041abc77d0a777e6c64f9ac6ff44305) for a version with tutorials.
