# Sequence Jacobian

Interactive guide to Auclert-Bard√≥czy-Rognlie-Straub:
 "Using the Sequence-Space Jacobian to Solve and Estimate Heterogeneous-Agent Models". 

## 1. Resources

- Beamer slides
- Krusell-Smith notebook
- HANK notebook
- HA Jacobian notebook


### 1.1. Beamer slides

**A good place to start.** You'll find a brief history of solution methods and where the
sequence-space Jacobians fit in; a formal description of our key concepts; and a demonstration of
their usefulness. The goal of these slides is to provide you with the big picture before you dive into the code.

### 1.2. Krusell-Smith notebook

**The first example.** A comprehensive tutorial in the context of a simple HA model. If you don't have Python,
 just start by reading the `html` version.

### 1.3. HANK notebook

**The second example.** Illustrates that our method generalizes well to larger models with significant
nonlinearities. Allows us to showcase the automatic chaining of Jacobians and address the issue of local determinacy.

### 1.4. HA Jacobian notebook

**Inside the black box.** A step-by-step examination of our core algorithm to compute Jacobians of HA blocks.
Starts from an intuitive, brute-force construction, then shows how to exploit *time symmetries* in backward and forward iteration for a 400x speed gain.    

## 2. Setting up Python

To install a full distribution of Python, with all of the packages and tools you will need to run our codes,
download the latest [Python 3 Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution.
**Note:** make sure you choose the installer for Python version 3. 
Once you installed Anaconda, you will be able to play with the notebooks we provided. Just open a terminal, change 
directory to the folder with notebooks, and type `jupyter notebook`. This will launch the notebook dashboard in your
default browser. Click on a notebook to get started. 

For more information on Jupyter notebooks, check out the
[official quick start guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you'd like to learn more about Python, the [QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/) lectures of
Tom Sargent and John Stachurski are a great place to start.
