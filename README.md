# Sequence-Space Jacobian

A unified framework to solve and analyze heterogeneous-agent macro models.

Python toolkit based on [Auclert, Bard√≥czy, Rognlie, Straub (2021): "Using the Sequence-Space Jacobian to Solve and Estimate Heterogeneous-Agent Models"](https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA17434). 

**Note:** Version 1.0.0-alpha was released on October 25 2021.

## 1. Resources

- New documentation and tutorials are coming soon.
- The previous version (with tutorials) is available under tag v0.1.0.

## 2. Setting up Python

To install a full distribution of Python, with all of the packages and tools you will need to run our code,
download the latest [Python 3 Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution.
**Note:** make sure you choose the installer for Python version 3. 
Once you install Anaconda, you will be able to play with the notebooks we provided. Just open a terminal, change 
directory to the folder with notebooks, and type `jupyter notebook`. This will launch the notebook dashboard in your
default browser. Click on a notebook to get started. 

For more information on Jupyter notebooks, check out the
[official quick start guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you'd like to learn more about Python, the [QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/) lectures of
Tom Sargent and John Stachurski are a great place to start.
