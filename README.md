### 1.1 RBC notebook

**Warm-up.** Get familiar with solving models in sequence space using our tools. If you don't have Python,
 just start by reading the `html` version. If you do, we recommend downloading our code and running the Jupyter notebook directly on your computer.

### 1.2. Krusell-Smith notebook

**The first example.** A comprehensive tutorial in the context of a simple, well-known HA model. 

### 1.3. One-Asset HANK notebook

**The second example.** Illustrates that our method generalizes well to larger models with significant
nonlinearities. Uses tools that automatically combine the Jacobians of individual model blocks. Also addresses the question of local determinacy.

### 1.4. Two-Asset HANK notebook

**The third example.** Showcases the workflow for solving a state-of-the-art HANK model with sticky prices, sticky wages, and capital adjustment costs. Introduces the concept of solved blocks.

### 1.5. HA Jacobian notebook

**Inside the black box.** A step-by-step examination of our fake news algorithm to compute Jacobians of HA blocks.    

## 2. Setting up Python

To install a full distribution of Python, with all of the packages and tools you will need to run our code,
download the latest [Python 3 Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution.
**Note:** make sure you choose the installer for Python version 3. 
Once you install Anaconda, you will be able to play with the notebooks we provided. Just open a terminal, change 
directory to the folder with notebooks, and type `jupyter notebook`. This will launch the notebook dashboard in your
default browser. Click on a notebook to get started. 

For more information on Jupyter notebooks, check out the
[official quick start guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you'd like to learn more about Python, the [QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/) lectures of
Tom Sargent and John Stachurski are a great place to start.
