"""Tools for deprecating older SSJ code conventions in favor of newer conventions"""

# The code in this module is meant to assist with users who have used past versions of sequence-jacobian, by temporarily
# providing support for old conventions via deprecated methods, providing time to allow for a seamless upgrade
# to newer versions sequence-jacobian.
